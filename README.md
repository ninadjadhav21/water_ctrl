# A simple watering system

A HTTP server which accepts manual starting and scheduled starting of water pump.
Use of SPIFFS filesystem in SPI Flash to store schedule data. This option works on any ESP development board without any extra hardware.

## How to use the example

### Wi-Fi/Ethernet connection
```
idf.py menuconfig
```
Open the project configuration menu (`idf.py menuconfig`) to configure Wi-Fi or Ethernet. See "Establishing Wi-Fi or Ethernet Connection" section in [examples/protocols/README.md](../../README.md) for more details.

### Build and Flash

Build the project and flash it to the board, then run monitor tool to view serial output:

```
idf.py -p PORT flash monitor
```

(Replace PORT with the name of the serial port to use.)

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the Getting Started Guide for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
